DONE: expose the BackendService router at localhost:9246 so we can make get and post requests to it
    TODO: will we be able to send a POST request to /backend/driver/install in a GUI HTTP Client and somehow see its streaming response in real time?

GET /backend/driver {"currentVersion":"","requiredVersion":""}
POST /backend/driver/install <streams download progress>
POST /backend/driver/install

init flow
GET /backend/driver
if driver not installed, open new window to /installdriver.html and ask the user to click "Install driver" which calls /backend/installdriver
if driver version not match, open new window to /installdriver.html and ask the user to click "Install driver" which calls /backend/installdriver
GET /backend/status/flow to get a list of flow actions
for each flow action, initialize a new row in the table

does driver exist?

option.DriverDirectory = filepath.Join(cacheDirectory, "ms-playwright-go", playwrightCliVersion)

$HOME/browserautomate/playwrightdriver
$HOME/browserautomate/playwrightdriver/package
$HOME/browserautomate/chromeprofile

automate excel documents?
